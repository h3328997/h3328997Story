A brown bear named Gray is living in Madison. He has a gray skin.
He met another fellow bear but this bear was black. He asked what his name was,
to which the bear replied, "Brown". What an odd name for a black bear, Gray
thought to himself. 
"So what's the matter?" Brown asked. Gray looked at the sky, with sorrowness all written on his face. "Have you wondered why my name is Gray but I'm a brown bear? I don't even know who I am anymore."
